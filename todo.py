# - implement inventive?
# - implement dig deep
# - implement actual Condition class so that I can do fleeting
# - right now ward doesn't affect escape turn
# - bosses shouldn't have explore option
# - boss combats should be min 7 turns, max 10 turns?
# - refactor enemy actions so that I can compose targets with effects easier
# - enemy that steals or strips your conditions?

# Design notes:
# - There needs to be doom action every n runs?
# - Every 4 runs? I guess? I need to mark part of the map as corrupted?
#   is that really the mechanism i want to use? Yeah because it means
#   you need to escape from a dangerous spot now and that's fun.
# - regions now have a level of corruption? Yeah not on the layer level yet?
# - 

# - So actually let's say -- you get 3 characters? Each character has 3 lives.
#   The world is persistent between characters.
# - Still not enough ways to attack / deal damage. That feels very premium...
#   More charges for items does help, and maybe that's enough for now?
