# - implement inventive?
# - implement dig deep
# - implement actual Condition class so that I can do fleeting
# - refactor enemy actions so that I can compose targets with effects easier
# - enemy that steals or strips your conditions?

# Plane playtest:
# - `set` command for setting conditions (set block to 0)
# - Would maybe be better if progressing rituals involved a choice.
#   This way they feel more real and you have some agency over them?
#   They should feel like big powerful things? And be shared among the whole map?
#   Maybe they take 9 energy to complete?
# - At the beginning of the run you choose the ritual you're working on?
#   All excess energy goes to that ritual. Maybe off-color energy still counts,
#   it's maybe just 1 progression instead of 3 for on-color energy? Takes 30 progress?
# - When the ritual goes off, it lasts for 3 encounters on everyone?
# - This means I could go back to having only 1 ritual? Then I replace the second
#   ritual you learn with some other form of progression?
# - Better UI visibility for rituals -- show it during spell choosing?

# Satisfying:
# - exploring (Flavor text for exploring! When you press x!)
#   Small chance for explore to be useful immediately
# - Idea: finding dead person's stuff
# - Spell design was good
# - Have blocking give you more intrinsic rewards?
#   (maybe pacifist mode gets you special rewards?)
#   Taming?
# - Building spellbook for combat is fun
# - having 4 actions is good
# - creeping shadow design good

# Notes:
# - finding right color energies is difficult sometimes
# - reconsider refreshing mechanic
# - more FLAVOR!
# - city-building at the end
# - non-combat events in between fights, gathering / harvesting
# - narrative:
#   - character customization
#   - options for specializing as a healer or slayer or something
#   - building safe havens
# - move healing friends to before `onwards/rest` choice
