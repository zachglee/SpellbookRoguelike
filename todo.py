# - implement inventive?
# - implement dig deep
# - implement actual Condition class so that I can do fleeting
# - right now ward doesn't affect escape turn
# - bosses shouldn't have explore option
# - boss combats should be min 7 turns, max 10 turns?
# - refactor enemy actions so that I can compose targets with effects easier
# - enemy that steals or strips your conditions?

# Design notes:
# - There needs to be doom action every n runs?
# - Every 4 runs? I guess? I need to mark part of the map as corrupted?
#   is that really the mechanism i want to use? Yeah because it means
#   you need to escape from a dangerous spot now and that's fun.
# - regions now have a level of corruption? Yeah not on the layer level yet?
# - 

# - So actually let's say -- you get 3 characters? Each character has 3 lives.
#   The world is persistent between characters.
# - Still not enough ways to attack / deal damage. That feels very premium...
#   More charges for items does help, and maybe that's enough for now?

# Nicole playtest notes:
# - options to heal (maybe heal more during resting)
#   better healing for healing a friend
# - some way to do little bits of damage
# - always visible key for commands

# Satisfying:
# - exploring (Flavor text for exploring! When you press x!)
#   Small chance for explore to be useful immediately
# - Idea: finding dead person's stuff
# - Spell design was good
# - Have blocking give you more intrinsic rewards?
#   (maybe pacifist mode gets you special rewards?)
#   Taming?
# - Building spellbook for combat is fun
# - having 4 actions is good
# - creeping shadow design good

# Notes:
# - finding right color energies is difficult sometimes
# - reconsider refreshing mechanic
# - more FLAVOR!
# - city-building at the end
# - non-combat events in between fights, gathering / harvesting
# - narrative:
#   - character customization
#   - options for specializing as a healer or slayer or something
#   - building safe havens
# - move healing friends to before `onwards/rest` choice
